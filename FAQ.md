## Moneyd FAQs

### How much XRP do I need in my wallet for a Codius host?
36+ XRP is required:
* 20 as base reserve (required for wallet activation)
* 10 escrowed in paymentChannelCreate tx
* 5 added to reserve to allow paymentChannel walelt functionality (now 25 in reserves)
* 1 XRP to facilitate the tx fees burned during these initial transactions.

If less than required XRP is in wallet, you will likely see this error on your host:
```
ilp-plugin-xrp-asym-client Error creating the payment channel: tecUNFUNDED One of _ADD, _OFFER, or _SEND. Deprecated. +0ms
```
* To rectify, add funds to your wallet and restart moneyd.

### Can I run multiple instances of Codius from one wallet?
Yes! 
* Add a unique name to your moneyd configuration using the below function:
```
moneyd xrp:configure --advanced
```
* If running on a machine already setup with moneyd, you'll have to delete your `.moneyd.json` file first.
* If running on a machine already setup with moneyd, you'll need to run a `moneyd xrp:cleanup` to remove old paymentChannels
* Tutorial coming soon.

## Codiusd FAQs

### Should I run the setup as root user?
Yes!
* Log in as root for entire setup process (hyper/moneyd/codiusd).
* Failure to do so will cause errors like the following (even using sudo):
```
could not create leading directories of '/root/.npm/_cacache/tmp/git-clone-57fb2ba2 permission denied`
```

### How do I list pods (contracts) running on my host?
* Enter the command `hyperctl list`
```
[root@host1 ~]# hyperctl list
POD ID                                                 POD Name                                               VM name             Status

```

## Codius CLI (Codius) FAQs

### What decides if a contract (pod) is uploaded to my host? Is it random?
* If `--host` is specified during upload, a specific host can be chosen;
* If `--host` is left out / blank, a random host is chosen from the list of peers.
```
codius upload /tmp/example-manifest.json --host https://host1.codius.live --duration 200
```
